# Foot-Step-Power-Generation-
This project is designed to harness the mechanical energy from footsteps and convert it into electrical energy using piezoelectric discs. The generated power is stored in rechargeable 18650 lithium-ion batteries, which can be utilized for low-power applications. An Arduino Uno is used to process data and monitor power generation in real-time.
The system features an I2C-based LCD display that provides instant feedback by displaying either the generated voltage in millivolts (mV) or a simple "ON/OFF" status indicating whether power is being generated. Additionally, an LED indicator is integrated to visually signal when power is being produced. The Arduino reads analog voltage values from the piezoelectric setup and updates the display accordingly.
This project is an eco-friendly and sustainable energy solution, ideal for applications in public walkways, smart cities, and high-footfall areas. It demonstrates a practical approach to renewable energy generation while providing real-time monitoring and power storage capabilities.
