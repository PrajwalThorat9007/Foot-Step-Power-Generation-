# Foot-Step-Power-Generation-
This project is designed to harness the mechanical energy from footsteps and convert it into electrical energy using piezoelectric discs. The generated power is stored in rechargeable 18650 lithium-ion batteries, which can be utilized for low-power applications. An Arduino Uno is used to process data and monitor power generation in real-time.
